# FaeHavenMod
Minecraft Forge Mod Implementing the Fairy Realm of Light and Dark Fae.

High Technology is not a good idea.  High magic is the reward.

The Fae are at war.  Choose a side.

Will you pick the light fae who wish to bring order and beauty into play?  They despise those who practice the blood arts as well as thaumaturges who descend into the forbidden arts.  They offer Aerie Magic which rivals blood magic in both scope and beauty...that's their opinion.

Will you pick the dark fae who demand release from the ancient laws.  They favor blood magic users as well as all forbidden arts and the corruption they bring to the worlds.  They offer Shadow Magic, which may not have the shear power of Aerie magic, however it does bring plenty of sneaky and deadly tricks to the table.

Will you become an Arbiter who favors no side in the war and is thus hated by both.  You may learn either school of magic, or both Aerie and Shadow, if you could just find somebody to teach you...
